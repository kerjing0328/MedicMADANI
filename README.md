## 📖 Overview

**MedicMadani** is an application built on the Malaysian Smart ID infrastructure.  
It solves a critical challenge in emergency healthcare: balancing **instant access** to lifesaving data with **strict patient privacy**.

The system uses a **Tiered Access Model**:

- **Paramedics (Offline/Online)** – Instant access to “Golden Hour” data (Blood Type, Allergies) via NFC/QR with **no internet required**.  
- **Doctors (Online)** – Full clinical history requiring biometric authentication & provider verification.  
- **Citizens** – Manage their own profile, insurance, and biometrics securely.

Reimagining Smart ID not only as identity, but as a **portable medical vault**.

- Stores essential emergency info for offline instant retrieval.
- Unlocks deeper medical records through tiered, role-based access.
- Works across ambulances, clinics, and hospitals — no central lookup needed.
- Gives citizens control over what data is public (emergency) vs private (clinical).
